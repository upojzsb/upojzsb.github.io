# Overall

This blog is developed based on [Qiubaiying](https://github.com/qiubaiying/qiubaiying.github.io), and as a just-for-fun project, I have made some modifications. This post is used to record  modifications to my blog.

# Configuration

## _config.yml

- Change **url** parameter from *http* into *https*.

 This will affect all links related to **site.url**, such as **[sitemap.xml](https://upojzsb.github.io/sitemap.xml)**

# Theme

## Dark theme

To make my blog more eye-friendly, I decided to change the theme to a dark theme. Introducing [css](https://github.com/upojzsb/upojzsb.github.io/commit/794f389fdc859d4674b4a58103c81971189f97ca) in [head.html](https://github.com/upojzsb/upojzsb.github.io/commit/a5b1edbace7fba25dcddc0a12e12ff9c4c035ddd) to achieve this effect.
